title: Why a Second Brain?
---

As someone that has tried Instapaper and pinboard.in and Pocket and a few other read later services and RSS feed and general content consumption I realized nothing was sticking for me.

But in late 2021 I heard words like 'zettlekasten' and '[second brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/)'  and 'digital gardens'- ideas and processes that were quite new to me.

During 2021 I started to look at content differently. And with certain tools I started to process it differently too.
