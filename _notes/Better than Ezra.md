Better than Ezra performing [Good on Letterman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m4XiXLpXDs) has me thinking.

During the first verse he really reminds me of early Green Day in the way he's singing. But Dookie didn't come out until 1995.

It almost sounds like he loved grunge and punk and he came out of New Orleans.

Good would be a (good) karaoke song
