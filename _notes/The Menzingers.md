## My Gistory of The Menzingers

The Menzingers would come on Spotify sometimes. I knew they were the Philly bar band that came up in the era of Tigers Jaw, Balance & Composure, and The Wonder Years. When they'd come on a playlist I'd focus on The Gaslight Anthem and Lucero tracks that would come.

To be honest, I wrote The Menzingers off. They were too loud. Too punk. I wanted the emo side of the music, not the punk side of the music.

Some years passed and *After The Party* came out and it was making Best of 2017 lists all the way from Noisey and Alternative Press to the blog-god, Stereogum.

I gave it a couple spins and it started to trickle into my life. *Lookers* and *Thick as Thieves* made their way onto playlists and more Daily Mixes and I wouldn't press skip. It developed into *Your Wild Years* and *After the Party*.

Once I heard those two tracks I knew this album, and specifically those songs, were for my 30+ year old ass. Being in a relationship with someone that didn't know me in my 20s, these songs really hit a heartstring of my youth mixed with my current life.

> you're the kinda girl that desveres the world. i'm just the kinda guy that promises the world. maybe everything is fine and it's all in my head.

These melodies and lyrics hit like the day after a covid booster. The lyrics resonated in a way that I knew I had to dig deeper into The Menzingers and see what else is going 
on.

It was then I realized we all just grow up. The Menzingers became a band about trying to get along with your girlfriends dad, about being hot when you're young, about just wanting to hang out with that *one* person after the party.

Then I reverse engineered the sitaution. I went backwards and back to *On the Impossible Past* and discovered the poetic alt-punk that was happening the same time I was ready for Seperation by Balance & Composure to drop. I realized everyone was growing up the same way, just processing it a different way. Myself included. I was transitioning through jobs, lovers, houses, and coming out on the other side just slightly more adult.
