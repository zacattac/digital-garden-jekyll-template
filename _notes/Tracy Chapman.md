While listening to Tracy Chapman's [self-titled debut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Chapman_) that came out in the late 80s I was really taken back by how modern it sounded.

Released on April 5, 1988, Tracy was only 24 releasing this acoustic anthems that were not something you heard on a popular scale in the 80s. But this contemparny folk album paved the way for so many after it - just look at Lillith Fair in the 90s.

As most of us know *Fast Car*, the other songs really speak to me in sounds I really only heard of artists after her. For people like Ani DiFranco all the way to Garth Brooks I hear all kinds of their music in Tracy's sound.

I love the way she could be on the stage with a country artist or a pop artist and still hold her own.](<While listening to Tracy Chapman's [self-titled debut](%3Chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Chapman_(album)%3E) that came out in the late 80s I was really taken back by how modern it sounded.

When I listen to [*Across the Lines*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEHXyFmdVeI) I hear melodies used in 90s country songs. I hear inspriration from Hurricane by Bob Dylan. I get rap cadences in some of the beats.

Soundone should make a beat from the guitar part of this song - that could be kinda tight.
