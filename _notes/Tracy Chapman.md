While listening to Tracy Chapman's [self-titled debut](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Chapman_(album)>) that came out in the late 80s I was really taken back by how modern it sounded.

Released on April 5, 1988, Tracy was only 24 releasing this acoustic anthems that were not something you heard on a popular scale in the 80s. But this contemparny folk album paved the way for so many after it - just look at Lillith Fair in the 90s.

As most of us know *Fast Car*, the other songs really speak to me in sounds I really only heard of artists after her. For people like Ani DiFranco all the way to Garth Brooks I hear all kinds of their music in Tracy's sound.

I love the way she could be on the stage with a country artist or a pop artist and still hold her own.
