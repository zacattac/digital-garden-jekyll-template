### Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music Vol 1 & 2 (1962)

First note: it's not country and western music - at all

[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Sounds_in_Country_and_Western_Music) told me it's current coutnry and western performed in popular sounds of songs of the time (1962). 

> The album departed further stylistically from the [rhythm and blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues "Rhythm and blues") music Charles had recorded for [Atlantic Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Records "Atlantic Records") in the 1950s. It featured [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music"), [folk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music "Folk music"), and [Western music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_music_(North_America) "Western music (North America)")[standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_(music) "Standard (music)") reworked by Charles in popular song forms of the time, including R&B, [pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music "Pop music"), and [jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz "Jazz"). Charles produced the album with [Sid Feller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Feller "Sid Feller"), who helped the singer select songs to record, and performed alongside saxophonist [Hank Crawford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Crawford "Hank Crawford"), a string section conducted by [Marty Paich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_Paich "Marty Paich"), and a [big band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_band "Big band") arranged by [Gil Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Fuller "Gil Fuller") and [Gerald Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Wilson "Gerald Wilson").

It's an interesting album for me. It isn't what I expected Ray Charles to sound like when I think of Georgia on My Mind or whatever is slapper is.

==This is more poppy. More 50s pop, early 60s pop, right before the Beatles pop. Maybe it's this R&B kinda guy doing late 50s/early 60s pop music. This blind pianist with a soulful voice doing non-soulful versions of soulful country songs.== It works.

**Note to self:** Maybe I should go back and listen to the country/western versions of these songs. See if there's real soul there.
