### i wanna live in your bedroom

this song is about vulnerability

> Take me home tonight  
I’m all yours  
I don’t wanna party, anymore  
==Dress me in your clothes  
Drown me in your pool  
I wanna live in your bedroom==

Those last three lines. Those are being vulnerable. And being that with someone else. That's a very rare feeling.

### Notes

one of the best songwriters this side of 2000. austin texas based and comes throught with a pweowerful voice that will knock your core to the bone and make you feel his timbre in the deepest part of your guts.

the imaregy ramirez picks off of everyday situations while holding an acoustic guitar and making sure you hear every word. it's something you can't hold in a basement venue.

i first saw him open for joe pug in probably 2012 or so. i wasn't wanting to see the opener but there i was. someone int he back of the crowd yells "the bad days" to him and it kinda catches him off guard, being the opener and all. but i remember he sarcastically said, "oh the part of the night where people start telling me how to do my job" - it was a playful jab. but a few songs later he played it. and it floored the the room. you could hear a pin drop from the opener and it was something so worthwhile. one of the best singer/songwriter song i've ever heard.
